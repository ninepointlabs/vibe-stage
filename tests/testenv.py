"""Shared test-environment isolation & hard guard, imported first by every
Python test file that can reach the filesystem (test_bridge.py and friends),
and mirrored in shell form at the top of tests/run-all.sh for the QML scene
tests that spawn qmlscene rather than the bridge.

Why this exists: a test run once deleted the owner's LIVE Vibe Stage data dir
(the Chromium profile with the sign-in) because a test process inherited the
real HOME/XDG_DATA_HOME - none of them were overridden - and a bridge code
path (the orphan-lease wipe) computed its delete target from those, in the
same process tree as the real engine.

Two independent things happen here, in order:

1. ISOLATION: point HOME/XDG_DATA_HOME/XDG_CACHE_HOME/XDG_CONFIG_HOME/
   XDG_STATE_HOME, and SOLFA_RUNTIME_DIR/SOLFA_PROFILE_DIR/SOLFA_CACHE_DIR,
   at a fresh temp dir, and set SOLFA_TEST=1 (the marker bin/vibe-stage-bridge's
   delete/rename helpers refuse to touch a real dir under - see
   refuse_if_real_path there). XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/WAYLAND_DISPLAY are left
   alone: the QML scene tests need the real Wayland/Hyprland session.

   If SOLFA_TEST_ENV_ROOT is already set (tests/run-all.sh sets it once for
   the whole suite), that root is reused and this module does not clean it
   up on exit - run-all.sh's own trap does that. Run standalone (a single
   test file, or a probe), this module creates its own root and registers
   the cleanup itself.

2. HARD VERIFY: after isolating, resolve every one of those vars again and
   refuse to proceed (exit non-zero, before any test runs or any file is
   touched) if any of them still lands inside the owner's REAL per-user
   dirs - computed from pwd.getpwuid, never from $HOME, so this cannot be
   fooled by a test that only overrides $HOME and leaves XDG_DATA_HOME (or
   vice versa). This is the check that would have caught the incident.
